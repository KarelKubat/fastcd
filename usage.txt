Usage:   fastcd INITIALS

Fastcd attempts to locate a directory indicated by the first characters of
INITIALS. The directory is searched for from: the current directory, $HOME,
and finally from /. A list of hits is shown.

Example: `fastcd ulb` might resolve in /usr/local/bin, /Users/leo/books, etc.
Initials in the argument are compared without case sensitivity.
