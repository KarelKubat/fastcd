Usage: fastcd [FLAGS] INITIALS

Fastcd attempts to locate a directory indicated by the first characters of
INITIALS. The directory is searched for from: the current directory, $HOME, and
finally from /. A list of hits is shown on stderr. Once you make a selection,
the chosen result is shown on stdout.

Example: `fastcd ulb` might resolve in ~/united/liberated/blurbs,
/usr/local/bin, etc.

Supported flags:
  -h, -? : This text
  -i     : Matching of initials is done case-insensitively (`ulb` will also
           match /Users/leo/books)
  -v     : Displays the version ID and stops.

Fastcd invocations are meant to be evaluated by your shell. E.g. for bash:
  cd $(fastcd ulb)
Or use a handy function:
  function fcd() { cd $(fastcd $1) }
